## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
For the two lower divs to get the outcome required
- Mobile-first workflow
Yeah and probably the only way that works with cards too

### What I learned

The hover state of the box image was a nice addition ...
Had to link the view image with css to get the required outcome
Still didn't get the required blend even after trying to play around with the z-index thoug ...that was a bummerðŸ˜’



```html

<div class="card-img">
  <img src="images/image-equilibrium.jpg" alt="body-img">
  <div class="view"></div>
</div>

```

```css

.card-img .view:hover {
  background-color: var(--cyan);
  background-image: url("../images/icon-view.svg");
  background-repeat: no-repeat;
  background-position: center;
  z-index: 1;
  opacity: 0.75;
}

```
